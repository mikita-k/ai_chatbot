# LLM Chatbot for Parking Space Reservation

A multi-stage project implementing a complete intelligent chatbot system for parking space reservations using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation), human-in-the-loop approval, and persistent storage.

## Quick Start

See [IMPLEMENTATION GUIDE](docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md) for detailed setup and usage instructions.

---

## Original Technical Specification

Development of a Chatbot for Parking Space Reservation. The goal is to develop an intelligent chatbot that can interact with users, provide information about parking spaces, handle the reservation process, and involve a human administrator for confirmation ("human-in-the-loop"). The project will be divided into 4 stages, with each stage implementing a specific functionality.

General Requirements:
Programming Language: Python.
Frameworks: LangChain, LangGraph.
Architecture: Based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
Vector database: Recommended options include Milvus, Pinecone, or Weaviate,
General Features:
The chatbot provides information (general information, working hours, prices, availability of parking spaces, location).
The reservation process is based on interactive collection of user data, including name, surname, car number, and reservation period.
The system should prevent exposure of sensitive data (e.g., private information stored in the vector database).
Evaluation of system performance (e.g., request latency, information retrieval accuracy).
Providing the result: 
for each task, please provide a link to your GitHub or EPAM GitLab repository in the answer field
you can earn extra points if you provide the following artifacts: 
a PowerPoint presentation explaining how the solution works, including relevant screenshots
a README file with clear project documentation (setup, usage, structure, etc.)
Automated test cases are implemented using pytest or unittest  (at least 2 tests per module)
CI/CD automation and/or Infrastructure as Code (e.g., Terraform)
If the code is poor quality, or too basic to be practical, and includes critical errors, the grade may be reduced




# Stage 1: Creation of a RAG System and Chatbot
What should be done
*

1. Implement the basic architecture of the chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation to interact with users.

2. Integrate a vector database for storing information.

(Optional) Solution can be improved by splitting source data into 2 data types: dynamic data (e.g. space availability, working hours, prices) and  static data (e.g. general information, parking details, location, booking process).  Store static data in vector database but dynamic data in SQL database.
3. Implement interactive features:

Provide information to users.
Collect user inputs for reservations.
4. Implement guard rails mechanism. Add a filtering to prevent exposure of sensitive data (e.g., using pre-trained NLP models for text analysis).

5. Perform evaluation of the RAG system:

Performance testing.
Response accuracy measurement (e.g., using metrics like Recall@K and Precision).
Outcome:

Working chatbot capable of providing basic information and interacting with users.
Data protection functionality.
Evaluation report on system performance.

# Stage 2: Implementation of Human-in-the-Loop Agent
What should be done
*
Tasks:

Create the second agent using LangChain to interact with the administrator.
Chat bot should be able to send a reservation request to administrator and get confirm/refuse response from him.  (e.g. via email server, messenger, rest api ).
Organize the integration with the first agent so that the reservation request is escalated to the human administrator after collecting details from the user.
Key Features:

Generating and sending reservation confirmation requests to the administrator.
Receiving responses from the administrator.
Maintaining communication between the first and second agents.
Outcome:

Automated system that connects an administrator for reservation approval.

# Stage 3: Process confirmed reservation by using MCP server
Not Started
Starts Feb 14, 2026 Ends Feb 28, 2026 (14 days)

What should be done
*
Tasks:

Use any open-source MCP server that provides functionality to write data to file.  Alternatively, develop a simple MCP server using Python + FastApi to process confirmed reservations. 
In case of MCP server is not possible to implement, use tool/function call for writing dada into file.  
﻿

Once the administrator (second agent) approves the reservation, the server should write the reservation details to a text file.
File entry format: Name | Car Number | Reservation Period | Approval Time.
Ensure the server is secure and resistant to unauthorized access, while ensuring reliable service.
Outcome:

A fully functional MCP server integrated with the previous agents.
The server processes reservation data and saves it in storage.

# Stage 4: Orchestrating All Components via LangGraph
Not Started
Starts Feb 14, 2026 Ends Feb 28, 2026 (14 days)

What should be done
*
Tasks:

Implement orchestration of all components using LangGraph.
Ensure complete integration of all stages:
The chatbot (RAG agent) interacts with users.
The system escalates reservation requests to the administrator via a human-in-the-loop agent (second agent).
The MCP server processes data after confirmation.
Implement the workflow logic for the entire pipeline:
Example graph structure:
Node for user interaction (context of RAG and chatbot).
Node for administrator approval.
Node for data recording.
Conduct testing of the entire system workflow.
Outcome:

A unified system where all components seamlessly interact with each other.
Stable operation of the entire pipeline.
﻿

Additional Details:
System Testing:

Conduct load tests to evaluate the performance of each component:
Chatbot in interactive dialogue mode.
Administrator confirmation functionality.
MCP server recording and storage process.
Perform integration testing of all steps during orchestration.

Documentation:
Prepare documentation for system usage:
Architecture description.
Agent and server logic.
Setup and deployment guidelines.
